# HotelAPI

API for hotel room management as test for Alten

## Rules

- For the purpose of the test, we assume the hotel has only one room available
- To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can’t be longer than 3 days and can’t be reserved more than 30 days in advance.
- All reservations start at least the next day of booking,
- To simplify the use case, a “DAY’ in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59.
- Every end-user can check the room availability, place a reservation, cancel it or modify it.
- To simplify the API is insecure.

## Requirements
 - Visual Studio 

 - .NET Core 3.1

 - SQL Server with a local DB
 
## Setup
The only change required is to change the connection string in appsettings.json to your local database (if it's not called localhost)

After that if the connection string is correct, the DB will be generated for you on the first run of the application and will include all Entity Framework migrations.

## Backend API Endpoints

### (GET) api/Resvation/GetAll
Gets all reservations for the hotel in order to look for availability (Excluding ones in the past)

### (POST) api/Resvation/Create
Creates a Reservation

### (PUT) api/Resvation/Update
Updates a Reservation

### (DELETE) api/Resvation/Delete
Deletes a reservation

## Architecture

This project is built with an N-Layer architechture including a business layer and a data layer, also includes a test project which contains tests for the service class in the business layer

Includes Swagger for the documentation

## Database Architecture

The Database only has 1 table which is for reservation with the following columns

- Id : Is primary key and the identifier for the reservations
- StartDate : Date and time in which the reservation starts
- EndDate : Date and time in which the reservavation ends
- CustomerName : Name of the person who made the reservation

## Important

StartDate and EndDate will take the time as inputs with the date but all the validation will use only the date, making the reservation valid from 0:00:00 to 23:59:59 as requested, otherwise to change this we could use a validation to accept only those times or use a string with a specific format for the date that would be needed to be parsed later on.

## Improvements
- Add Customer table and relate to reservation's table
- Add Room table and relate to reservation's table
- Authentication
